Title: Human Detection Application with Interactive Terminal

Overview: The Human Detection Application is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI)program that combines real-time human detection capabilities with an interactive terminal that simulates code typing. It utilizes the YOLOv5 deep learning model for detecting human presence in video streams or images and provides a visually engaging terminal interface that displays code snippets with typing sound effects. Users can launch a camera feed, select video files, or choose images for analysis, all while observing a terminal that simulates the dynamic typing of code.

Key Features:

Real-Time Human Detection:

Utilizes the YOLOv5 model for efficient and accurate detection of human figures in video streams or images.
Supports various input sources, including the default webcam, DroidCam, or video files selected by the user.
Interactive Terminal:

Features a terminal window styled with a green-on-black color scheme, mimicking classic coding environments.
Simulates typing of code snippets with a customizable typing speed, providing an engaging user experience.
Plays a sound effect (click.mp3) with each character typed, enhancing the realism of the typing simulation.
Toggle Typing Functionality:

Allows users to start and stop the typing simulation by pressing the space bar, providing an interactive element to the application.
Resumes typing from the last point when reactivated.
User-Friendly GUI:

Built with Tkinter, the application offers a straightforward interface for users to navigate and execute various functionalities.
Includes buttons for launching the camera, connecting to DroidCam, selecting video files, and choosing images for human detection.
Displays the count of detected humans in real-time on the video feed or image.
Customizable Code Display:

The application is designed to display customizable code snippets, allowing users to modify the displayed content as needed.
Technology Stack:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used:
Tkinter for GUI development
OpenCV for image processing and video capture
Pygame for sound playback
PyTorch for loading the YOLOv5 model
Conclusion: The Human Detection Application with an Interactive Terminal not only serves as a powerful tool for detecting humans in real-time but also engages users through a unique and interactive terminal experience. This project showcases the integration of deep learning, GUI development, and multimedia elements, making it a versatile application suitable for educational, research, and practical applications in human detection and interaction.
